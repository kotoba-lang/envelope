(ns envelope.projection
  "The other half of the envelope: the rules for the plane that is **not**
  sealed.

  `envelope.model` owns what a sealed object looks like. This owns what may
  be written next to it — the queryable facet a server can read and index,
  which exists precisely because ciphertext cannot be joined.

  ## Why this needs a guard at all

  Splitting a record into a sealed envelope and a queryable projection is the
  established shape in this workspace (`cloud-itonami-rirekisho`,
  `kotoba-lang/kagi`, `etzhayyim/com-etzhayyim-talent`). Superproject
  ADR-2608070400 D2 makes it the default, and its Consequences name the
  failure mode this namespace exists for:

  > 射影面の非識別性は client の責任であり、server は検査しない。射影の設計を
  > 誤れば、暗号は無傷のまま PII が平文で出る。これは構造上 server 側では防げない。

  The crypto cannot fail here and still lose the data. The projection leaks it
  in plaintext, correctly encrypted, through the front door.

  ## Two lessons carried from the three prior implementations

  **1. Check the shape, not the prefix.** `com-etzhayyim-talent` enforces
  \"identifying fields must be `signal:v1:` ciphertext\" by testing the string
  prefix, so `\"signal:v1:\" + plaintext` satisfies it. `rirekisho` fixed this
  by asking whether the value *is* what sealing produces. `sealed?` here is
  structural for the same reason: a rule a caller can satisfy by writing a
  string is not a rule.

  **2. Walk to any depth.** `rirekisho/leaks` inspects only top-level keys.
  That is sufficient there because a closed allowlist rejects unknown keys
  anyway — but a cohort/projection facet has *open* keys by design, so the
  same check on it would miss `{:cohort/skills [{:name \"…\"}]}`. `leaks` here
  walks maps, vectors, sets and seqs.

  ## What this cannot do, stated so it is not mistaken for coverage

  It finds identifying **attributes**. It cannot find an identifying **value**
  under an innocuous key — `{:cohort/note \"山田太郎 in Osaka\"}` passes, because
  deciding that a string is a name is domain knowledge this namespace does not
  and should not have. The guard raises the floor; it is not a PII detector.
  A projection whose free-text fields carry identity is still a leak, and the
  only thing that catches it is choosing not to project free text."
