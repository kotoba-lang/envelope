  "The envelope: what a sealed object's key material looks like, and every
  decision about it that can be made WITHOUT crypto.

  One object (a Drive file, a stored mail body) is encrypted once, under one
  random content key. That key is never stored — only copies of it wrapped to
  each recipient's X25519 public key. Sharing re-wraps; it never re-encrypts
  the object. This namespace owns the shape and the rules; `envelope.seal`
  (ClojureScript, async, Web Crypto + @noble/curves) owns the bytes.

  Split on purpose: everything here is pure and portable, so the rules that
  actually matter — nonce uniqueness, what a revoke does and does not
  accomplish, what the AEAD binds — are testable without a crypto runtime,
  on every runtime this workspace targets.

  "The AES-GCM nonce for chunk `i`: epoch (4 bytes, big-endian) || index
  (8 bytes, big-endian). Returned as a vector of unsigned bytes so this
  stays pure `.cljc`.

  Deterministic rather than random on purpose. GCM's one unforgivable
  failure is reusing a nonce under the same key, and a deterministic
  counter makes that a property you can check by reading the code instead
  of a probability you argue about. The content key is fresh per object, so
  (key, index) is unique — as long as a chunk is never re-encrypted in
  place, which is exactly what the epoch is for: rewriting any chunk bumps
  `:envelope/nonce-epoch`, so the rewritten chunk gets a nonce no previous
  chunk under this key has ever used.

  Reading a chunk uses the epoch recorded for THAT chunk, not the
  envelope's current one — see `chunk-epoch`.

  Built from `quot`/`rem`, not bit shifts, and that is not a style
  choice: JavaScript's bitwise operators truncate to 32 bits and take the
  shift count modulo 32, so `(unsigned-bit-shift-right i 32)` is
  `(unsigned-bit-shift-right i 0)` there. The first version of this
  function shifted, and under ClojureScript the top four bytes of the
  index came out as a copy of the bottom four — a nonce that disagrees
  with the same spec implemented on the JVM. Caught by
  `a-nonce-is-never-reused-under-one-key`, which is why it asserts exact
  bytes and not merely distinctness."

  **It also binds the KEM, and that is a downgrade defence.** Without it a
  classical wrap and a hybrid wrap for the same (object, recipient) carry
  byte-identical AAD, so the two are interchangeable as far as the AEAD is
  concerned. An attacker who can make the hybrid path fail — a stripped
  ML-KEM ciphertext, a client that falls back on error — could then have a
  classical wrap accepted where a hybrid one was intended, and the
  post-quantum half would be gone without anything refusing.

  `:x25519` keeps the original string exactly. Adding the KEM to it would
  have changed the AAD of every wrap already written, and AAD must match
  byte-for-byte or the wrap stops opening. So the classical form is frozen
