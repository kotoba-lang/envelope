  "The hybrid key encapsulation behind `:x25519+ml-kem-768`.

  X25519 alone means a wrap harvested today opens the day a
  cryptographically-relevant quantum computer exists — and the wrap holds
  the content key, so that is the whole object. Combining X25519 with
  ML-KEM-768 (FIPS 203) means an attacker has to break **both**: the derived
  key is HKDF over the concatenation, so either shared secret being secret
  keeps it secret. That is why this combines rather than replaces —
  a hybrid is never weaker than the classical construction it extends, and
  ML-KEM is young enough that this matters.

  ## Where the primitives come from, and why here

  `@noble/post-quantum`'s `ml_kem768`, bound thinly. X25519 and HKDF still
  come from `kotoba-lang/org-signal` — this namespace does not touch them.

  Two other ML-KEM bindings exist in this workspace, and neither is a home
  for this one:

  - `kotoba-lang/kagi`'s `kagi.crypto.noble` is an actor's crypto provider.
    A library depending on an actor inverts the dependency direction.
  - `kotoba-lang/pqh`'s `pq_noble.cljs` is the `IPq` host that repo's README
    calls future work. It has been written but sits **uncommitted** in the
    shared checkout since 2026-07-20; building on someone's unlanded working
    tree is not a dependency, it is a coincidence.

  `kotoba-lang/org-signal` would be the principled home — Signal specifies
  PQXDH over ML-KEM — but it implements X3DH only, and growing it a
  post-quantum half is its own piece of work, not a side effect of this one.

  The `envelope` README's rule is that a **second X25519 implementation**
  would be a second one to get wrong. This is not an implementation; it is a
  call into an audited one. Three thin bindings to the same audited
  primitive is a consolidation opportunity, not a correctness hazard — but
  it is an opportunity, and it is recorded here so it is not forgotten.

  ## Sizes (FIPS 203, ML-KEM-768)

  public key 1184 B · ciphertext 1088 B · shared secret 32 B. Every wrap to
  a hybrid recipient therefore carries 1088 bytes more than a classical one.
  That is the price, and it is per recipient, not per object."
